# Python Telegram Bot - Password Generator
First pet project on building a Telegram Bot
The bot is built with python and hosted on AWS EC2. The project was inspired by my dislike toward my repetitive usage of the same password across different platforms. You can test the bot out at @kormingsoon_bot (changing bot soon)
